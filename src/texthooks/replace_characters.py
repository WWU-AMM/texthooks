"""
A fixer script which crawls text files and replaces smartquotes with
normal quote characters.

This fixes copy-paste from some applications which replace double-quotes with curly
quotes.

For extra credit, it handles alternate encodings of quotation marks and
dingbats.

It does *not* convert corner brackets, braile quotation marks, or angle
quotation marks. Those characters are not typically the result of copy-paste
errors, so they are allowed.

Low quotation marks vary in usage and meaning by language, and some languages
use quotation marks which are facing "outwards" (opposite facing from english).
For the most part, these and exotic characters (double-prime quotes) are
ignored.

In files with the offending marks, they are replaced and the run is marked as
failed. This makes the script suitable as a pre-commit fixer.
